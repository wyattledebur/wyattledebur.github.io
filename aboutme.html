                        Life is a movie, and mine is a pirate movie, sailing to wherever the winds take me. I do not know what I want to do yet as a career but that does not mean I am not going to try stuff. I am liking coding and who knows what else I would like to do for the rest of my life. I am planning on trying out classes and activities that sound fun to me so I can find a job I would like to do. I hear people say if you do what you love you will never work a day in your life and that sounds like the dream right there.

                        I have always been a very laid back person and am not afraid of taking my time to make sure I get a job I truly enjoy. Even though I am laid back that does not mean I do not put the work in. Ever since middle school I have taken the hardest math classes and in highschool I have taken other AP classes besides math.

                        In my freshman and sophomore year I was part of my schoolâ€™s track team along with most of my friends. It taught me about being a part of something bigger than myself. The events might be split up but you still have groups of participants. I was on the throwers team and made some great friends there, we practiced most of the time away from the other groups but we would always warm up together and spend non practicing time together. There were no heroes, just good people trying their best.

                        When going with the flow there are times that you need to take the flow by the horns. And I have enjoyed the journey so far and am thankful for you taking some time to listen but, there is always more to come if you want to see something that you might not of if you did not take a chance.
