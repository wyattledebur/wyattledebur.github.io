        <p>I encountered two pretty big obstacles while coding my Python Text adventure. One difficulty I encountered was that when I used contractions in my print statements it would end my print statement early. And another problem I encountered was that my code was not working properly because I was ending every line with a semicolon like I was coding Javascript.  To fix my first problem I needed to change my print statements from parentheses and single quotation marks to double quotation marks or take the contractions out. Javascript has you put a semicolon at the end of every line so I had to figure out where I still needed a semicolon or colon or not.</p>
